# 🌾 Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning 🚜

## Overview 📜

This project uses machine learning to predict crop yields or suitability based on various environmental and agricultural factors. The initial data exploration is based on the Money Heist episode analysis in `MoneyHeist.csv` and performed in the `KNN.ipynb` notebook.

**🚨 IMPORTANT: The project currently contains a notebook (`KNN.ipynb`) and a CSV file (`MoneyHeist.csv`) with content related to Money Heist episode analysis. This `README` assumes that these files will be updated with code and data relevant to crop prediction. 🚨**

## Data 📊

The data (currently - but **should be changed**) is stored in the `MoneyHeist.csv` file. The CSV contains the following columns:

*   **Date:** 📅 Release date of the episode (should be Crop Data Date).
*   **Season:** 🔢 Season number (likely irrelevant).
*   **Episode:** 🔢 Episode number within the season (likely irrelevant).
*   **Title:** 💬 Episode title (original language - should be replaced).
*   **Title(English):** 💬 Episode title (English translation - should be replaced).
*   **Description:** 📝 Episode description/summary (should be replaced).
*   **Rate:** ⭐ Episode rating (likely from IMDb - irrelevant).
*   **RateNumber:** 🗳️ Number of ratings for the episode (irrelevant).

**⚠️ WARNING: This data description is based on the Money Heist data in the notebook. It MUST be updated to reflect the actual Crop Prediction data. ⚠️**

**Expected Crop Prediction Data Fields:**

*   **Location:** 📍 Geographic coordinates of the farm/region.
*   **Crop Type:** 🌾 Type of crop being grown.
*   **Soil Type:** 🌱 Type of soil in the region.
*   **Rainfall:** 🌧️ Average rainfall in the region.
*   **Temperature:** 🌡️ Average temperature in the region.
*   **pH Level:** 🧪 Soil pH level.
*   **[Other relevant features]** ➕

## Project Structure 📂

*   `KNN.ipynb`: 📓 Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis. (**MUST BE UPDATED!**)
*   `MoneyHeist.csv`: 💾 The dataset used for initial exploration. (**MUST BE REPLACED!**)

## Dependencies ⚙️

The project uses the following Python libraries:

*   pandas
*   matplotlib
*   seaborn
*   scikit-learn (for machine learning - add other libraries)

You can install these using `pip` (remember to create a `requirements.txt` file):
